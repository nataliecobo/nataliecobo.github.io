# Neogranadina

I am one of the founding members of Neogranadina, a non-profit foundation devoted to digitising the holdings of endangered archives and libraries in Colombia and promoting the digital humanities. In partnership with the Medici Archive Project, the Universidad de los Andes and the Universidad del Cauca, the foundation is currently digitising three key early-modern collections in Popay√°n and Tunja at the rate of several thousand images every week, using low-cost scanners that we have designed and built ourselves. With the help of international allies, we are in the process of setting up an online archive to make these images available to everyone, around the world, for free.
