## Cristophorus Mylaeus, *De Scribenda Universitates Rerum* (Basel, 1551)
I have also translated Book II (“de Prudentia”) of Cristophorus Mylaeus’s *De Scribenda Universitates Rerum* (Basel, 1551) for Mark Meadow (UCSB History of Art and Architecture), which he used for his 2021 article, [“Quanta prudentia et usus administrandae reipublicae: Quiccheberg and Mylaeus on the utility of techne.”](https://doi.org/10.1093/jhc/fhab002)
