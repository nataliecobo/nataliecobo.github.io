title: The legislation of the Archdiocese of Santafé in the colonial period
---

<img src="/img/legislacion_cover.png" style="width: 300px; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px;" align="right" /> This was a collaborative project with Juan Fernando Cobo Betancourt to produce the first complete edition of the ecclesiastical legislation of the New Kingdom of Granada in the colonial period with explanatory notes and a critical commentary. The edition is composed of four texts — the constitutions of the diocesan synods of 1556 and 1606, the 1576 catechism of Archbishop Zapata, and of the First Provincial Council of Santafé of 1625 — and I was involved in transcribing and translating the Provincial Council from the original Latin and also in compiling the critical apparatus.

 This project was generously funded by the Instituto Colombiano de Antropologia e Historia in Bogotá and the resulting volume was published in 2018.
