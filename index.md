My name is **Natalie Cobo** and I am a legal and intellectual historian of the early modern Iberian World. I approach this work in three ways: historical research into the **early modern Iberian world**, **Neo-Latin translation**, and **digital humanities**.

My current monograph, [***Paper Archipelao: The Spanish invasion and colonization of the sixteenth century Philippines***](/paper-archipelago) examines how Spanish settlers, officials, and missionaries established a colonial administration and the practical consequences of this for Indigenous peoples. It explores how the Spanish conquest was effected; the contingent and circumstantial development of local colonial policies and institutions within the broader normative framework of Spanish imperialism and early modern European legal culture; and the ways in which Indigenous communities interacted with and shaped colonial impositions.

I am a translator of Neo-Latin and my current project, based at the [Max Planck Institute for European Legal History](https://www.lhlt.mpg.de/research-project/translating-solorzano?c=4620677), Frankfurt, aims to produce a translation and critical edition of the key work of seventeenth-century Spanish administrative jurisprudence, [***de Gubernatione***](/translating-solorzano), by Juan de Solórzano y Pereira, from Latin into English and Spanish.

I am a co-founder of the Colombian registered non-profit foundation [Neogranadina](https://neogranadina.org), which has become a leader in the field of digital humanities in Latin America over the last decade. The core of our work is the design and production of low-cost archival document scanners, which we donate to archives in the Global South to digitize their collections, and work with them to make the resulting images freely available.
